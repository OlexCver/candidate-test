# UX-designer test

Your task is to implement a new feature to view and document one on one meetings between two users.

In the ux-designer folder there is a wireframe "Wireframe Employees one on one.png" that shows a basic view of the feature. For this task you should follow the design manners that Winningtemp uses today and the design proposal should follow the style according to "Design style Winningtemp.png".

At the top of the page the user should be able to select a user who they want to invite to the one on one meeting. When a user is selected the view should show a brief summary information about the user and previous meetings are presented. In the toolbar there should be a button to create a new meeting and filter controls to filter the contents of the timeline below. The timeline should contain information about previous meetings and each meeting should have a header and a functionality to expand and collapse detailed information. Users should be able to comment on each meeting. If there are any comments on a meeting these should be presented. At the right is information that should show whether the user has verified the meeting or not. 

#### Task 1
Create a complete design proposal based on the wireframe where the design is ready for implementation. 

The design proposal should be an image (.png, .jpg or any format that can be opened by a common image viewer).

#### Task 2
Implement your design proposal with your own HTML and CSS.

**Requirements:**

- It is important that the design is responsive, meaning it should look good on small devices as well as desktop devices.
