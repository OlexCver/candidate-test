- <a name="ux-designer-test">UX-designer test</a>

## <a name="front-end-test"></a>Front-end test

In the front-end folder there is a screenshot named "front-end-design.png". This is an actual screenshot from a feature in Winningtemp. 

#### Task 1
Re-implement this design with your own HTML and CSS.

**Requirements:**

 - The design should look as similar as possible to the screenshot
 - The design should be responsive, meaning it should look good on small devices as well as desktop devices
 - The values in the matrix are decimals with one decimal point from 0.0 to 10.0. A question mark is used when a value is missing (no value).
	 - The background colors in the matrix are based on the value:
		 - Value less than 2.0: #ff1f40
		 - Value between 2.0 and 4.0: #fc9526
		 - Value between 4.0 and 6.0: #f6d827
		 - Value between 6.0 and 8.0: #c9e223
		 - Value greater than 8.0: #97e126
		 - No value: #cccccc

#### Task 2
Implement your design in javascript using whatever framework you like (React, Angular, vue.js, jquery, plain javascript). 

**Requirements:**

- The javascript code should be able to render the design with a dynamic set of rows and columns based on some kind of data structure
- Extra points for providing unit tests with your code

## <a name="ux-designer-test"></a>UX-designer test

In the ux-designer folder there is a screenshot named "answer-per-question-design.png". This is an actual screenshot from a feature in Winningtemp. The screenshot shows the current distribution of responses to a four-digit scale (red = 0, orange = 1, light green = 2 and green = 3) on specific questions.

#### Task 1
Create a complete design proposal based on the sketch where the design and elements are refined and ready for implementation. The design proposal should be an image (.png, .jpg or any format that can be opened by a common image viewer).

#### Task 2
Implement your design proposal with your own HTML and CSS.

**Requirements:**

- It is important that the design is responsive, meaning it should look good on small devices as well as desktop devices.

#### Task 3
Implement new functionality that is not included in the sketch. There is a need for users to identify questions as particularly important. Add a functionality to tag and highlight a question. Feel free to come up with a solution on your own. The functionality should be implemented using HTML and CSS.
